Building Diamonds on Windows with MinGW

1. Dependencies

    For each of the following, download the Windows release binary for the 
    dll(s) that diamonds.exe will require sit along side it for it to work. 
    Also download the development binaries for the headers Diamonds includes 
    and the lib*.a files that will have to be linked into the  executable.

       SDL       - libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
       SDL_image - libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
       SDL_mixer - libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
       SDL_ttf   - libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

    Also, download the Windows source for wxWidgets.

       wxwidgets.org/downloads/

    This you will have to first compile from source in and of itself. 
    Diamonds will need access to the headers from the wxWidgets include 
    directory and to be linked with two of the produced library files:
    libwxbase*.a and libwxmsw*_core.a.

2. Copy the contents of this directory (build-win32-mingw) one level up to
   where the rest of Diamonds' source is.

   If you use the Dev-C++ IDE (bloodshed.net) you should be able to open the  
   included Diamonds.dev file and use it to compile Diamonds.

   If not, try using the included makefile, which was automatically generated 
   by Dev-C++.

      mingw32-make -f Makefile.win

   Either way, it's important g++ is able to find the necessary headers and 
   link the right libraries, and in the right order too.

   With Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2, you can click Tools -> Compiler Options, select the
   Directories tab, and add entries to the Libraries and/or C++ Includes 
   lists as necessary. You can also right click the name of the project at 
   the top of the file listing in the Project Browser down the left side of 
   the screen and click Project Options. From there, click the Parameters tab 
   and you can edit the list of paremters to be passed to the linker. The 
   wxWidgets libraries might not have exactly the same names as have been 
   already specified depending on the version of wxWidgets and what options 
   you compiled it with.

   Without the IDE, you'll have to edit the LIBS and CXXINCS parameters in 
   the makefile in a text editor manually.
